== 2.0.0 /2015-03-09
 * Completely rewritten execution engine
   * dropped Ruby 1.8.x, 1.9.x support, added 2.x
 * Rewritten configuration engine and new format for configuration files
 * Step by step status updates can now be sent to streaming reporters
 * Core separated from standard implementations
 * No database dependencies, no AR model. 
 * No more disk IO in unit tests

== 1.3.0 /2012-11-28
* remove most of the gem dependencies by not requiring parsers and reporters in the core
* update gem dependencies
* switched license to MIT
* officially abandon 1.8.7 support

== 1.2.4 /2011-11-29
* fixed a regression in parsing the configuration
* updated gem dependencies
* added Bundler configuration for development purposes
* activerecord now loaded on demand to improve startup times
* 1.9 compatibility!
* the mixed sample/tests are now clearly split between examples and test data
* Documentation overhaul started. 4 years of cruft to get rid of
== 1.2.3 /2011-05-03
* parser interface expanded for configuration validation
* parser interface expanded to allow separate parsing of setup and teardown scripts
== 1.2.2 /2011-04-05
* Actually fixed all the places where path expansion takes place.
== 1.2.1 /2011-04-04
* The configuration code no longer assumes that you are passing files. configuration.tests= now assumes you're passing an array of strings and it is the responsibility of the parser to make heads or tails from that. The configuration is clever enough to detect paths relative to the configuration file and expand them.
* some minor cosmetic changes in the documentation
== 1.2.0 /2011-04-01
* refactored library structure
* More unit tests. We're now over the magical 80% coverage point
* Updated gem dependencies for activerecord to the newest version
* Deprecated rutemax. The command now is simply rutema (avoids observed confusion). Will remove in 1.3.0
== 1.1.3 /2010-12-23
* fixed dependency handling of Rutema::RakeTask within the block.
== 1.1.2 /2010-12-22
* Rutema::RakeTask accepts dependencies

* added YAML dump reporter	
* Fixed a bug in the initialization of StepRunner that prevented use of --step
== 1.0.9 / 2010-03-22
* Fixed (hopefully) a nagging bug in activerecord reporter where it would crash if a step had status nil.
* Fixed the same behaviour in the text reporter
* Improved the logging of steps to avoid a debug logging exception that messed logs up
* Thinned out the debug logs
== 1.0.8 / 2009-11-13
* ActiveRecordReporter now accepts all activerecord adapter parameters - you can now connect to DBs other than sqlite3
* Reporter delegation now more robust (rutemax will exit gracefully and log if one reporter bombs)
* The old db connection code was removed. Explicit dependencies to adapters are also absent - you have to now have the appropriate gems for the ActiveRecordReporter to work properly
== 1.0.7 / 2009-09-11
* Steps now include the commandline (if there) in their name - makes the logs more readable

== 1.0.6 / 2009-09-04
* The run context is now passed to the runner and subsequently to the TestStep#run method
	This way you can pass informaton to the command being run (context contains information on the start time of the run, the spec filename as well as any information added in the configuration)

* The runner adds the current scenario name to the context passed
== 1.0.5 / 2009-07-16

* Setup and teardown are no longer executed for check tests
* fixed bug in element_prompt where a negative answer would not set an error
* TextReporter now shows the failed tests first, followed by tests with warnings, not executed tests and finally the successes. This gives a better overview of the important bits
* removed require "rubygems" from library code
== 1.0.4 / 2008-11-7
* Added functionality that allows ignoring the result of a step. The step is considered always successful
== 1.0.3 / 2008-10-28
* The name of the configuration file is added in the context information - can be used to group results together in cases where there are multiple configurations
* Context is now stored as a Hash
* EmailReporter now displays a footer as defined in it's configuration
== 1.0.2 / 2008-10-23

* Locked the Ramaze version to 0.3.5 until we find out why the new version breaks us
== 0.6.3 / 2008-03-26
* Bugfix: specifying a .spec filename on the commandline did not work - Path expanded before changing directory.
* Bugfix: running an attended .spec on it's own was not possible - attended mode is now set for single runs.
* Cleaned up the Runner's log output
== 0.6.2 / 2008-03-12
* Parsers derived from Rutema::SpecificationParser now receive the system configuration so that conventions like tools, paths and context can be used in element_ methods (this functionality fell through the cracks with the change in parser implementation)
